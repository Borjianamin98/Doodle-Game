# Doodle Game (SDL Project)

Doodle Game is a desktop game inspired by Android Doodle created using SDL Library.

I wrote this game as my last term project for C++ project in Shahid Beheshti University

This game is published with SDL2 License.

This game is simple and I implement most of feature from android game in my app.
